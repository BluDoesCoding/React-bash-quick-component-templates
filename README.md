1. Place the repo in your project.
2. Create a convenient alias in your bash profile or simply call the script.
```console
alias f='PATH/fillcomp.sh'
```
3. Modify the templates for your own needs but keep in mind changing the 'MyComponent' symbol has you to rename it in the regular expression inside the bash script as well.
